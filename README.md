###Analysis Overview
This analysis was commissioned to further understand the patters across multiple city types for drivers in a ride sharing environment.  The analysis looked at number of drivers, average and total fares and number of rides given.  The outputs should allow decision makers to understand where to put additional infrastructure in place and where to invest more heavily in.

##Results
#-Urban
As one would expect the overall volume of rides is higher in Urban cities and that higher demand drives an increase in drivers.  As there is more competition and given the potentially shorter drives the average fare per ride and driver is lower.   That lower fare is likely made up with the much higher volume of rides given, almost 3x higher than a suburban city type.  An interesting detail on Urban cities, is that there are more drivers than rides given today, leading us to signal caution on further investment/growth here.

#-Suburban
The suburban city type  has a higher fare per ride and average per driver driven by having less drivers compared to urban cities (80% less drivers) and unlike Urban cities is not oversaturated by drivers.  

#-Rural
Rural city types have a substantially lower number of drivers and provide much less rides overall.  Given the lowest ratio of drivers to rides and the likely longer distance of drives, Rural drivers enjoy the highest fare per driver, roughly 60% higher than suburban and over 200% higher than Urban drivers.  That said, the number of rides are substantially lower than other city types leading to a substantially lower total revenue.

#-Seasonality
All city types appear to be relatively consistent on a seasonal basis.  No one month driving noticeably higher weekly fare than another

##Summary
Finding additional drivers in an Urban city type may prove difficult give the saturation of drivers that exists today.  Investment should be made on a city by city basis with a focus on ensuring a balance of ride demand to drivers.  Investments in Rural cities may provide some benefit, but given the low overall demand for rides, caution would be advised.  Suburban cities would be the place to target, keeping in mind the need to maintain a balance of ride demand to drivers.
